# Monolithic E-Commerce Application Description:

The application is a traditional e-commerce platform that encompasses all functionalities within a single, unified software architecture. The application handles the following key operations:

- User Management: Manages user profiles, authentication, and authorization. It stores personal information, manages login sessions, and handles user preferences.

- Product Catalog: Maintains a comprehensive list of products, including descriptions, pricing, images, and inventory levels. It supports product search and categorization functionalities.

- Order Processing: Manages all aspects of the ordering process, from cart management to order placement, payment processing, and order history tracking.

- Customer Support: Handles customer inquiries, returns, complaints, and feedback through a ticket-based system integrated with the user and order databases.

The application is built on a single relational database that holds all user data, product information, orders, and customer support interactions. It currently operates on a single code base with a web-based frontend that communicates directly with the backend server.

The platform has been experiencing challenges with scaling during high-traffic periods, frequent downtimes during updates, and increasing difficulty in implementing new features without affecting existing functionalities. The goal is to decompose this monolithic architecture into a microservices-based architecture to address these issues and improve overall agility and scalability.
